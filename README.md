# webcomposer
PHP script that can help you run composer even if you don't have SSH access to your server.  There are times when we want to run composer on a hosting box or somewhere we are not allowed shell access through SSH or other methods. WebComposer will help you do some of the basic work using composer even when you have no SSH access. A web server with FTP access can easily run.
